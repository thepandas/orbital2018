* An expenditure and income tracking application 
* A school project under the National University of Singapore

## Android Studio setup

	* NOTE: If it returns an error `virtualenvwrapper could not find virtualenv in your path`, it means `virtualenv` wasn't pointed to the correct directory. Please refer [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31274642/error-virtualenvwrapper-could-not-find-virtualenv-in-your-path) for a workaround.

## Level of Achievement
* Apollo 11

## Motivation
* As our country slowly transits to a cashless nation where we can pay for our bills by scanning our debit/credit card or using mobile transaction apps such as paylah/paynow it is harder to keep track of our expenses unlike the past where we can do it by just flipping open our wallets to see the amount of cash we have left. We scan our cards and make transactions on application without keeping track of exactly how much we have spent and only realising the amount we have spent when we see our monthly E-statement(which may be too late in some cases). Therefore, it is necessary and convenient if we have an application that keeps track of our transactions and help us in our financial management.

## Aim
* To create an expenditure and income tracking application to help people better manage their finances in a society that is going cashless.

## Target Audience
* Everyone that does cashless transactions

## Find Application Functionalities
1. Expenditure/Income tracking
	* Uploading of bank statements to record transactions.
	* Automatic categorisation of transactions in the bank statements
	* Manual categorisation of cash input mode for users that withdraw money to spend instead. (Cash transactions) 
2. Data Visualizations
	* Provide information on the user’s expenditure through visualizations(eg Pie charts to show expenditure by category)
	* Allow for comparison(Inflows/Outflows) between different months based on the user’s choice
	* Allow for comparison between different category of spending based on the user’s choice
3. Budgeting
	* For users that are trying to save up for a gift/holiday or housing, the application will aid in the process to ensure that users do not overspend and stay on track.
4. News Feed
	* Allow readers to read the latest business/finance news
5. Wallet(Account Sharing)		
	* Allow for tracking of finances in small organisation/family through a shared common wallet
